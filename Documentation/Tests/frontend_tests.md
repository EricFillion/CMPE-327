# Seet Geek Frontend Tests

## Test Case Summarization Table

## Test Plan

**How our team organized the documentations of the test cases**
All of the documentation of the test cases are in the ***Documentation/Tests*** folder. We created the Documenation folder to have a centralized place to have all our documentation. The subfolder called ***Tests*** was created as a place for all our test documentation. For our documentation we have one main file called ***frontend_tests.md*** this file contains our test case summarization table, our test plan and issues that we encountered. We also created individual md files for each requirement/specification. These files are also located in ***/Documentation/Tests/*** and are named based on the requirement in the form "R{requirment_number} {route}.md" (ex. ***R1. /login.md ***). 


**Our understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including yur understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub**

**How we are going to organize different test case code files?**
All of our test case code files are going to be put in ***/qa327_test/frontend***. We will have individal files for each requirement. The file's names will be in the format "test_{requirementNumber}_{requirementType}.py" (ex. ***test_r1_login.py***). 

## Issues
*The conflicts and issues related to the specification that we found. For these issue we created an issue on GitHub for the on site customer and then documented what we found here*
- Issue 1: Unsure of the need to check R6:1-3(Buy requirments) as these are checked when the ticket is created. Were informed that these needed to be checked in case of issues such as user trying to enter a data with malicious intent.
