|-|-|-|-|-|
| test_update_ticket_* | Multiple   tests for update ticket functionality | Text   in assertion not found in the `message_error` or `message_info` element | Code   had extra text “Unable to update ticket: ” at front of the message | Add   “Unable to update ticket: ” to front assertion text |
| test_update_ticket_* | Multiple tests for update ticket   functionality | Could not submit the form with a   single field to update. So, the correct message was not being shown. | In test case documentation can   update a single field, whereas in the code all fields are updated at once | Update the test cases to have   the test_ticket’s info entered into the other fields that need to be updated |
| test_update_ticket_* | Multiple tests for update ticket   functionality | Element `#update_message` could   not be found | Instead of having an element   with an id of “update_message” we hade an element with a class name of either   “message_error” or “message_info” | Update the test cases to check   for “message_error” if it was a negative test case or “message_info” if it   was a positive test case |
| test_update_ticket_low_quantity | R5.3.1:  The quantity of the tickets has to be more   than 0, and less than or equal to 100 - Negative. Testing quantity below   range. | Assertion text did not match | Was checking that   `message_error` was “Unable to update ticket: The quantity of the tickets has   to be more than 0, and less than or equal to 100”  instead of “Unable to update ticket: The   quantity of the ticket must be between 1 and 100”   | Change test case to check for   the text “Unable to update ticket: The quantity of the ticket must be between   1 and 100”   |
| test_update_ticket_high_quantity | R5.3.2: The quantity of the   tickets has to be more than 0, and less than or equal to 100 - Negative.   Testing quantity above range. | Assertion text did not match | Was checking that   `message_error` was “Unable to update ticket: The quantity of the tickets has   to be more than 0, and less than or equal to 100”  instead of “Unable to update ticket: The   quantity of the ticket must be between 1 and 100” | Change test case to check for   the text “Unable to update ticket: The quantity of the ticket must be between   1 and 100”   |
|   test_name_alphanumeric  |   There is not enough args in function  |  Forgot to add `*_`  as second value in each function  |  Error message is not matched in assert_text   |   Add extra parameter in each function  | 
| test_user_buy_success | If there is no error, it return to home page  |  Forgot to use @patch("buy_ticket") decorator to inject db's return value | There is no return value and lead to a 500 server error  |  Add the decorator with correct return value.  |
